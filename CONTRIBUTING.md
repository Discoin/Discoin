## What to do
### Issues
1. Don't file disputes, do it [here](https://discord.gg/t9kUMsv).
2. Don't report downtime, blame Openshift. If you really want to help, donate a VPS (+ Subdomain, it's an API) or [some money](http://mtl0131.bigcartel.com) (You get Discoin-equivalent currency in return).
3. Don't question the code unless it's actually a bug. Specifically, don't tell me to switch to POST requests, accept JSON requests, respond JSON body, or anything similar.

### Pull Requests
1. **DON'T EDIT RESPONSE STRING!** (Strings after `res.sendRaw`)
2. Accept the fact that the live code itself isn't directly from GitHub and it takes time for your changes to actually enact in the live code.
